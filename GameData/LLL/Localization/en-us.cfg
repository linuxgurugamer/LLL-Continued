        #LOC_LLL_104 = Mk II Droopy

        #LOC_LLL_121 = LLL Conglomerate Aerodynamics (Ember)
        #LOC_LLL_122 = Due to numerous complaints that the MK VI Sparrow was too cramped, our engineers doubled the size. Unfortunetly this left the cup holders twice as wide and no-where near as good at holding a cup of coffee still during evasive maneuvers.
        #LOC_LLL_123 = Radial "Lemur" Bridge
        #LOC_LLL_124 = A surface attached interstellar bridge tower, placed on structures.

        #LOC_LLL_148 = The LLL-600 battery pack is a versatile, compact electrical charge storage solution designed for heavy loads. Well, really it's a whole load of AAAA batteries stuffed in a box. Don't hit it too hard, this thing's technically an electric pinata.

        #LOC_LLL_154 = Linear Aerospike

        #LOC_LLL_172 = While normally safe to operate, there is a switch on the Thermal Control Systems. You'll get a whole load more thrust but it'll blast chunks of highly radio-active material out of the back. Not good for continental real-estate prices. It may also lead to a slight 'nuclear meltdown'.

        #LOC_LLL_176 = Radial Turbo-Jet Engine
        #LOC_LLL_177 = Turns out building nuclear engines is really hard and expensive. So we just crammed jet engines in all the ones that didn't quite work. Good news is the residual radiation levels are almost safe. Probably wouldn't park any plane using these too close to a school, though.
